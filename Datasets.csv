Both the chips make separate assessments of the traffic and danger situation around the cars. The assessments are then matched and the car is guided accordingly if the outputs are the same. If there is ambiguity in the outputs obtained from the chips, then revaluation is done until a safe and suitable decision is taken. Thus, dual chips will enable better control over the navigation in self-driving Tesla cars."
